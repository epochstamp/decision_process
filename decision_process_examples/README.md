# Contributing
PRs about examples are welcome as long as they dedicate them a folder with a meaningful name, provide a reference into the current README and the following informations in the README located in the example folder.

## Command line
How to launch the example

## Quick summary
Explain in a few lines the SDP itself.

## Formal SDP model
Describe the SDP using a classical optimization problem formalisation framework.

## Input Parameters
This should be presented in tables. Might be referred in an external file if too long (e.g., long forecasts)

## Initialization
Same as input parameters. However variable initializations should definetely fit in tables.

## Realisation plots
Collection of plots. A script is available [here](http://coming_soon.com) to generate them easily from decision process realisations.
